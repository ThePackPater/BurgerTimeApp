* _*Eat-Da-Burger!*_ is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area has a _`Devour it!`_ button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

### Make Burgers and Devour them quick!
